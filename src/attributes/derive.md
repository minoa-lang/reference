# Derive attributes

## `derive` [↵](#derive-attributes)

The `derive` attribute allows new items to automatically implement code for a given type, and is mainly used to implement attributes.
The derive contains a list of derive meta-attributes to derive.
Each derive meta-attribute may be supplied additional data that is attached to the meta-attribute.
For example `@derive(foo(bar = 1))`, passes the inner `bar = 1` to the derive attribute.


It contains a list of meta data with paths to builtin traits to implement or derive macros to process.

## `auto_derive` [↵](#derive-attributes)

The `auto_derive` attribute is automatically added to any implementations generated by the `derive` attribute.
This attribute has no effect, but allows for tools and lints to detct that these have been automatically generated
