# Delimiters
```
<delimiters> := <opening-delimiters> | <closing-delimiters>
<opening-delimiters> := '{' | '(' | '['
<closing-delimiters> := '}' | ')' | ']'
```

Delimiters are special forms of punctuation that are used to surround an inner subsection of code.
An opening delimiter always needs to be paired with a closing delimiter.

There are 3 types of delimiters:
Delimiter   | Type
------------|----------------
`{` and `}` | (Curly) braces
`[` and `]` | (Square) brackets
`(` and `)` | Parentheses
