# Lexical structure

This section contains information about the lexical structure of a code file, which will be interpreted as tokens.

A token is a primitive in the gramar of a language. Tokens are produces from the incoming source file.
The supported tokens are defined below.
In addition to these, literals are also interpreted as tokens, but infomation about them is located within their own [section](#6-literals-).

> _Note_: The langauge is designed in such a way, that each line can independtly be parsed into a set of tokens without needing to have any context from the surrounding lines
