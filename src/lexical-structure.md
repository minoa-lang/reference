# Lexical structure

This section contains information about the lexical structure of a code file, which will be interpreted as tokens.

A token is a primitive in the gramar of a language. Tokens are produces from the incoming source file.
In addition to elements in this section, literals are also interpreted as tokens, but infomation about them is located within their own [section].

> _Note_: The langauge is designed in such a way, that each line can independtly be parsed into a set of tokens without needing to have any context from the surrounding lines
