# Abstract types
```
<abstract-types> := <path-type>
                  | <self-type>
                  | <optional-types>
                  | <result-type>
                  | <vector-type>
                  | <inferred-type>
```

An abstract type is a type which is a type that, while not being core to the type system and does not map to type within the compiler, has additional language support.
