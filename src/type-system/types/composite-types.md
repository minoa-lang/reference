# Composite types
```
<composite-type> := <tuple-type>
                  | <struct-type>
                  | <tuple-struct-type>
                  | <union-types>
                  | <enum-types>
                  | <bitfield-types>
```

An composite type is a non-uniform type which generally represents a collection of fields with different types.
