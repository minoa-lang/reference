# Function-like types
```
<function-like-types> := <function-types>
                       | <closure-types>
                       | <raw-function-types>
```

A function-like type represents the underlying type of closures and functions

Both function and closure types are unique types generated by the compiler for each function or closure, while raw function types are a generalized type for multiple functions.

Since every function and closure have their own type, the compiler can use this fact to do certain optimizations.

The types generally includes the name and full signature.
