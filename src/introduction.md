> Current version: 0.1

This book contains the current language reference for the Minoa language.
This is not the final specification yet, as teh langauge is still a work in progress.

This reference is an overview of the Minoa langauge in its current state and is written for the development of the langauge and  those who are interested in the language.

## This reference is provisional [â†µ](#introduction)

The contents of the reference is still provisional and is subject to change at any time.
This means the syntax, languages rules, core and standard libary, compiler infrastructure, package manager/build tool, and other aspect of the design that have not been decided on yet.
This therefore will contain gaps for parts that have not been decided on yet.
There may also be unclear language within this document that still needs to be refined during the development process.

In addition, the current name 'Minoa' is a work in progress (W.I.P.) name and may also still change in the future.
